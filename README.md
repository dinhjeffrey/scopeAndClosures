# scopeAndClosures

##Question 1: Scope
Consider the following code:
```
(function() {
   var a = b = 5;
})();

console.log(b);
```
What will be printed on the console?

###Answer
The code above prints ```5```.

There are two assignments but the variable ```a``` is declared using the keyword ```var```. What this means is that ```a``` is a local variable of the function. On the contrary, ```b``` is assigned to the global scope.

The other trick of this question is that it doesnâ€™t use strict mode (```'use strict';```) inside the function. If strict mode was enabled, the code would raise the error Uncaught ReferenceError: b is not defined. Remember that strict mode requires you to explicitly reference to the global scope if this was the intended behavior. So, you should write:
```
(function() {
   'use strict';
   var a = window.b = 5;
})();

console.log(b);
```
